Project Description:
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of patients developing cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality globally, making early detection essential for effective treatment and better health outcomes. By analyzing trends in patient records, the goal is to create a predictive model that helps healthcare providers identify high-risk individuals for timely intervention.

The dataset used comes from a public hospital and contains 308,854 rows and 19 columns, including socio-demographic and medical features. It has been anonymized for research purposes and includes variables such as general health, exercise, medical history

, and lifestyle factors. The target variable indicates whether or not a patient has cardiovascular disease.

The project is divided into two main phases:

Model Development:
Data cleaning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Implementation of strategies for unbalanced datasets.
Development and comparison of prediction algorithms.
Model Improvement and Evaluation:
Implementation of additional techniques to improve accuracy.
Identification of key predictive variables.
Selection of the optimal model.
Evaluation of model performance on different datasets.
Activities Included:
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.
Addressing unbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE and NearMiss.
Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
Implementing and comparing machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, and AUC.
Estimating the cost of implementing the best-performing model in a healthcare setting.
Utilizing GitHub for collaborative development and code management.
Conclusion:
The project aims to identify the best machine learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on sensitivity to minimize false negatives. By analyzing the most relevant predictors and using advanced machine learning techniques, the project provides actionable insights for healthcare providers to address at-risk populations effectively.
